# MindNotez
The project should eventually be a digital notebook, preferably notes one takes from texts.
The project is taken from the idea of Zettelkasten. One enters the main bibliographic information and has below a large text field
to enter the actual comments.

In the upper part of the application is the overview. Top-left is the usual path structure to select a project file. The content
of that file is read into the table in the center. So far, the content of the 'others' column is used to construct the pie chart
on the top-right.
